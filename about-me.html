    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <article>
     <p>Hi my name is Erik Kantrowitz is a junior test engineer working in robotics with a background 
      in software testing and a growing focus on frontend development. 
      He originally set out to study propulsion engineering, but after being assigned to a rover project in
      his university’s rocket club, he quickly discovered a passion for robotics.
      That interest deepened through the robotics club, where he eventually led one of the main projects 
      cementing
      his path toward building and improving complex systems.</p>

      <p>Outside of work and learning, Erik is a musician who plays upbeat, 
      driving indie music on drums and guitar. While it’s been a few years since he 
      played in a band, he still jams at home. He’s also an avid reader and makes a 
      point to spend time outdoors whenever possible. </p>
